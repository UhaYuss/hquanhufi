                Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), formerly known as Saigon, is the largest city and the economic, cultural,
                educational, and industrial center of Vietnam. HCMC is located in the southern part of the country and
                is divided into 24 districts.<br>

                HCMC has a rich and diverse history of culture, architecture, and cuisine. Famous destinations in HCMC
                include Ben Thanh Market, Saigon Notre-Dame Basilica, Independence Palace, War Remnants Museum, and
                large shopping centers such as Vincom Center, Parkson, and Saigon Square.
                HCMC is also known for its vibrant cultural and entertainment scene, with many cultural events, music
                concerts, and sports activities taking place throughout the year. In addition, HCMC has many parks and
                recreational areas, such as 23/9 Park, Tao Dan Park, and Suoi Tien Amusement Park.<br>

                HCMC is also an important economic center of Vietnam, with many developed industries and services,
                including
                manufacturing, financial services, tourism, and real estate. The city also has a large seaport and Tan
