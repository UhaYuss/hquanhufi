            Com tam, or broken rice, is a beloved dish in Vietnamese cuisine that is enjoyed by many for its unique taste and texture. The dish is named after the broken grains of rice that are used, which are a result of processing the rice. <br>

            The broken rice is cooked to perfection and served with a variety of toppings. The most common toppings include grilled pork chops, shredded pork skin, and steamed egg. The pork chops are marinated in a mixture of fish sauce, garlic, sugar, and other spices, then grilled to perfection. The shredded pork skin adds a chewy texture to the dish, while the steamed egg provides a delicate and fluffy contrast. <br>
            
            Com tam is often served with a side of pickled vegetables, which provide a tangy and crunchy contrast to the savory meats. The pickled vegetables are typically made from carrots, daikon radish, and cucumbers, which are thinly sliced and pickled in vinegar and sugar. <br>
            
            One of the most distinctive features of com tam is its sauce, which is a mixture of fish sauce, sugar, garlic, chili, and lime juice. This sauce adds a sweet, savory, and tangy flavor to the dish and complements the other ingredients perfectly. <br>
            
            Com tam is also commonly served with a side of chả giò, or fried spring rolls. The spring rolls are filled with ground pork, vermicelli noodles, mushrooms, and various vegetables, then deep-fried until crispy and golden brown. <br>
            
            Com tam is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed at any time of day. It is a popular street food in Vietnam, and many vendors offer it with a range of toppings and sauces. The dish is also served in restaurants, where it is often presented with a more elaborate presentation. <br>
            
            In conclusion, com tam is a delicious and unique dish that is a must-try for anyone looking to experience the rich and vibrant flavors of Vietnamese cuisine.
