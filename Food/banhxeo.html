            Banh Xeo, a Vietnamese savory crepe, is a popular and delicious dish that is enjoyed throughout Vietnam. The name "banh xeo" comes from the sizzling sound the crepe makes when it is cooked on the hot griddle. <br>

The crepe batter is made from rice flour and coconut milk, which gives it a light and crispy texture. The batter is seasoned with turmeric powder, which gives it a yellow color and a subtle flavor. <br>

The filling of banh xeo typically includes various meats such as shrimp, pork, and chicken, as well as bean sprouts, sliced onions, and mung beans. The meats and vegetables are cooked together in a wok until tender and flavorful. <br>

Banh xeo is traditionally eaten by wrapping a piece of the crepe with lettuce leaves and herbs such as mint, basil, and cilantro. The herbs add a fresh and fragrant flavor to the dish and complement the savory filling. <br>

Banh xeo is often served with a side of nuoc cham, a dipping sauce made from fish sauce, sugar, lime juice, and chili peppers. The dipping sauce adds a tangy and spicy flavor to the dish and helps to bring out the flavors of the crepe and filling. <br>

Banh xeo is a popular street food in Vietnam and is often cooked fresh to order in small stalls or food carts. It is a great option for a quick and tasty meal on the go. <br>

In conclusion, banh xeo is a delicious and unique dish that showcases the bold and vibrant flavors of Vietnamese cuisine. Its crispy crepe, savory filling, and fresh herbs create a mouthwatering taste that is hard to resist. Whether enjoyed on the street or in a restaurant, banh xeo is a dish that is sure to leave a lasting impression. <br>
